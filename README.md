# Weather site

This site is based on [an assignment from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

Its purpose is to practice using API calls and asynchronous code. The site shows the current weather and 7-day forecast of anywherre in the world.
